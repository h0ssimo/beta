He’s another character for my personal story.</p>\n<img src="/images/characters/minotaur/minotaur_by_hossimo_right.jpg" alt="minotaur_by_hossimo_right" class="responsive">\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>The Orcs rarely seem to be in need of help; specially when it comes to fighting, they’re more brutal than you can imagine.</p>\n<p>But when they’re in serious trouble, the only one able to lend a hand, is the great Minotaur. The enemy of you enemy is your friend, right? Together they can safely evade the assanination attempted by the Argonians, on the Orc boss.</p>\n<img src="/images/characters/minotaur/minotaur_by_hossimo_left.jpg" alt="minotaur_by_hossimo_left" class="responsive">\n<p>Nothing’s more important than water in a water-short planet crowded by a handful of mean creatures. The Argonians realised that before others, but thanks to the Minotaur, they failed to claim the Orcs’ resources.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>I wanted him to be sort of a manipulated human-being, didn’t really want him to be ultra-fantasy. So I made my art-direction decisions based on that fact.</p>\n<p>Although I changed a couple of them along the way later. Thought he’d be better with one of his horns broken (to break the symmetry) and removed the rope (since I wasn’t really happy with that in general, and honestly, didn’t find any use for it).</p>\n<p>And he’s meant to be around 7.5 feet tall.</p>\n<img src="/images/characters/minotaur/minotaur_by_hossimo_back_left.jpg" alt="minotaur_by_hossimo_back_left" class="responsive">\n<h3>Sculpting Process</h3>\n<p>I created this one using ZBrush, Maya, and Photoshop.</p>\n<p>I started off by a custom base mesh I created in Maya, which I use for most of humanoid characters. It’s always good to make sure that the base mesh’s UV’s are done properly in a 3D package like Maya (or whatever you’re comfortable with). It will become handy later.</p>\n<img src="/images/characters/minotaur/minotaur_by_hossimo_back_right.jpg" alt="minotaur_by_hossimo_back_right" class="responsive">\n<p>The details are mostly handsculpted, though a couple of alphas was used to make it look better.</p>\n<p>I rendered it using ZBrush. Just created a couple of renderpasses and composed them in Photoshop.</p>\n<img src="/images/characters/minotaur/minotaur_by_hossimo_all.jpg" alt="minotaur_by_hossimo_all" class="responsive">\n<p>For higher resolution images, please visit my Artstation.</p>',fields:{slug:"/Minotaur/",prefix:"portfolio/2018-06-11"},frontmatter:{title:"The Minotaur",author:"Hossein Moayed",category:"portfolio",date:"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z",cover:{childImageSharp:{resize:{src:"/static/minotaur_by_hossimo-fa8cd8720c187f2d8436e53469e8acac-ada8c.jpg"}}}}},authornote:{id:"/home/travis/build/h0ssimo/beta/content/parts/author.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:"<p>To make it short, I’m a 3D Character Artist experienced in character pipelines for both animations and games.</p>"},site:{siteMetadata:{facebook:{appId:"298710090861252"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/Minotaur/",prev:{id:"/home/travis/build/h0ssimo/beta/content/posts/portfolio/2018-05-04--The-Prof/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fields:{slug:"/The-Prof/",prefix:"portfolio/2018-05-04"},frontmatter:{title:"The Professor",category:"portfolio",tags:["realistic","sculpture"],date:"2018-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"}},next:{id:"/home/travis/build/h0ssimo/beta/content/posts/portfolio/2018-07-01--Minotaur-Action-Figure/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fields:{slug:"/Minotaur-Action-Figure/",prefix:"portfolio/2018-07-01"},frontmatter:{title:"The Minotaur Action Figure",category:"portfolio",tags:["fantasy","sculpture"],date:"2018-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}});
